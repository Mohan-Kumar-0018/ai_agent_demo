🎤 Slide 1: What’s Beyond LLMs & RAG?
Prompt:
“You’ve seen what LLMs can do with static prompts and retrieval-augmented generation. But what if they could act—query databases, call APIs, update files, and collaborate across tools?”

Core Idea:
LLMs give us reasoning, but AI agents give us action + memory + autonomy.

🧠 Slide 2: What is an AI Agent (in practice)?
Definition (framed for engineers):
“An AI agent is an LLM-powered software entity that can reason, plan, and interact with external tools or systems to complete tasks, often autonomously.”

🔑 Key Capabilities:
Tool usage (e.g., GitHub APIs, PostgreSQL, custom functions)

Goal-driven planning

Autonomous or semi-autonomous decision-making

Chaining actions over multiple steps

🧰 Slide 3: Why Use an Agent Framework like Agno?
“Rather than building fragile prompt chains, Agno helps you define tools, orchestrate reasoning, and manage execution in a reusable, extensible way.”

📦 Agno Features:
Tool registration (e.g., GitHubTools, PostgresTools)

Contextual execution

Reasoning + planning loop

Custom agent types

Integration flexibility

⚙️ Slide 4: Typical Agent Loop

    Start([Start])
    Think([Think: What is the task?])
    Plan([Plan: What tool or step is needed?])
    Act([Act: Use tool/API])
    Repeat([Loop until done])
    Done([Task complete])

    Start --> Think --> Plan --> Act --> Repeat --> Plan
    Repeat --> Done
🎬 Slide 5: What I’ll Show You Today
You can end the intro with a brief roadmap:

“In this demo, I’ll show agents that:

Pull issues from GitHub

Query a PostgreSQL database

Use a custom tool to [e.g., crawl or do a calculation]
You’ll see how they reason, choose tools, and act to accomplish a task end-to-end.”
